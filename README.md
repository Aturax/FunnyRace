FUNNY RACE
The project was made in 5 hours. I've spent most of the time thinking what kind of obstacles to make and designing the circuit.
I had problems animating the blocks properly. I haven't had enought time to make a way to animate the camera in order to follow
the player in certain moments and to stop near the obstacles and rotate it so the player can have a better vision and more exciting.

I would work on the player movement, adding a human model, some animations and ragdoll when hitting the obstacles. The game needs
more game feel, audio such as music and sound FX and maybe a little camera shake effect. Of course I should work on some textures
and doing the game more visual atractive.
